# serverless-sqlite

Serverless SQLite database read from and write to Object Storage Service, run on FaaS platform.

**NOTES: This repository is still in the early development stage.**

## Goals

- Use Object Storage Service as the underlying storage engine, such as AWS S3, Aliyun OSS, etc.
- Run on FaaS platform, multiple query instances can share the same database, can be scaled horizontally.
- Provide query interface via HTTP protocol.

## Why?

This is my first C++ project. I'm studying how to build a serverless database recently. Just for fun.

## Development

### Requirements

- C++ 17 compiler, such as GCC 9, Clang 10.
- Unix-like operating system, such as Linux, FreeBSD, macOS.
- Development tools:
  - **clang-format**: used to format the source code. Run the following command to install it:
    - Ubuntu or Debian: `apt install clang-format`
    - macOS: `brew install clang-format`

### Setup

- Initialize git submodule: `git submodule init && git submodule update`
- Install `sqlite3` library: `./vcpkg/vcpkg install sqlite3`
- Install `glog` library: `./vcpkg/vcpkg install glog`

## Reference

### libcephsqlite

This SQLite VFS may be used for storing and accessing a SQLite database backed by RADOS. This allows you to fully decentralize your database using Cephâ€™s object store for improved availability, accessibility, and use of storage.
Link: https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/api/libcephsqlite/

> - `PRAGMA page_size = 65536` - bigger page size
> - `PRAGMA cache_size = 4096` - cache 4096 pages or 256MB (with 64K page_cache).
> - `PRAGMA journal_mode = PERSIST` - don't deletes the journal for every transaction
> - `PRAGMA temp_store=memory` - put the temporary tables on memory

### sqlite-s3vfs

Python virtual filesystem for SQLite to read from and write to S3.
Link: https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs

> sqlite-s3vfs stores the SQLite database in **fixed-sized blocks, and each is stored as a separate object** in S3. SQLite stores its data in fixed-size pages, and always **writes exactly a page at a time**. This virtual filesystem **translates page reads and writes to block reads and writes**. In the case of SQLite pages being the **same size** as blocks, which is the case by default, each page write results in exactly one block write.
>
> Separate objects are required since S3 does not support the partial replace of an object; to change even 1 byte, it must be re-uploaded in full.
